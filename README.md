Stack-Overflow-Leaderboard
==========================

Just a quick and fun web app I created to keep tabs on who had the most reputation/badges on Stack Overflow amongst my team.

Feel free to contribute or host this yourself.

Install
==========================

To get the web app to display the users of your choice simply edit the semi-colon delimited list of IDs on line 5 of the main.js file.

These IDs can be found in the URL of the Stack accounts you would like to use.
