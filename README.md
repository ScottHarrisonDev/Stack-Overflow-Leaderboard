Stack-Overflow-Leaderboard
==========================

Just a quick and fun web app I created to keep tabs on who had the most reputation/badges on Stack Overflow amongst my team.

Feel free to contribute or host this yourself.

You can find a demo here: http://stack.scottharrisondesign.co.uk

Install
==========================

You will need an API Key which you can get here: http://stackapps.com/apps/oauth/register

To get the web app to display the users of your choice simply add your API Key and edit the semi-colon delimited list of IDs on line 5 of the main.js file.

These IDs can be found in the URL of the Stack accounts you would like to use.
